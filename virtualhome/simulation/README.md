# Simulation
This directory contains the *Unity Simulator* and *Evolving Graph* simulator API's. Remember that in order to run the Unity Simulator, you need to download and execute the appropiate unity executable. The *Evolving Graph* simulator does not require any unity executable. 

**[New]** Additionally, we include a class to use VirtualHome as an OpenAI Gym environment. Check out [environment/unity_environment.py](environment/unity_environment.py) for an overview. 

VirtualHome simulation works through 3 components:

- Agents: An agent is a humanoid avatar that can interact with the environment and perform actions. You can add multiple agents on each simulation, interacting at the same time.
- Programs: A sequence of actions representing an activity. Each action is formed by one subject, one verb and up to 2 object arguments (e.g. `<char0> [PutBack] <glass> (1) <table> (1)`).
- Environment: the environment where the programs will be executed. Each environment is represented as a graph, where correspond to objects with properties and `(e.g. CLOSED/ON)` and edges contain relationships between objects. 

Following, we provide documentation of the Environment settings and Actions currently supported.

# Agents
An agent is a humanoid avatar that can interact with the environment and perform actions. 

Agents in VirtualHome have a NavMeshAgent component, that allows them to navigate throughout the environment using shortest-parth planning, avoid obstacles and turning smoothly. They also have inverse kinematics through RootMotion FinalIK, to provide realistic animations when interacting with objects. 

You can add multiple agents on each simulation, interacting at the same time. To add an agent into the environment, call

```python
comm.add_character(char_name)
```

Where `char_name` corresponds to the character you want to add. These are the characters currently available, along with their name.

| Male1         | Female1       | Female2       | Female4       | Male10         | Male2         |

# Programs
The programs allow executing activities in VirtualHome a program is composed by a sequence of instructions of the form `<char{char_id}> [Action_name] <Object_name> (Object_id)`.

For example:

```python
program = [' <char0> [Walk] <chair> (1)', '<char0> [Sit] <chair> (1)']
```

You can also run programs for multiple agents at the same time, separating the instructions using a `|`.

```python
program = [' <char0> [Walk] <chair> (1) | <char1> [Walk] <fridge> (1)', '<char0> [Sit] <chair> (1) | <char1> [Open] <fridge> (1)']
```



Programs can also have preconditions, describing how should the environment be in order to execute the program. Following we show documentation of the preconditions and actions supported.

## Preconditions
List of preconditions that can be specified in the programs. The preconditions specify constrains in the environment where the program will be executed.
### Unary preconditions
- `object` is_on: `object` in `on` state.
- `object` is_off: `object` in `off` state.
- `object` plugged: `object` in `plugged_in` state.
- `object` unplugged: `object` in `plugged_out` state.
- `object` open: `object` in `open` state.
- `object` closed: `object` in `closed` state.
- `object` occupied: `object` has too many `on` edges to sit or lie in it.
- `object` free: `object` has no objects attached with `on` edges.
- `character` sit: `character` must have state `sitting` and edge `on` between character and an `object`.
- `character` lying: `character` must have state `lying` and edge `on` between character and an `object`.

### Binary preconditions
- `object` in `character`: `character` is wearing `object`. Edge `on` between `object` and `character`.  
- `object1` in `object2`:  Edge `on` between `object1` and `object2`.
- `object1` inside `object2`: edge `inside` between `object1` and `object2`.
- `object1` location `room`: edge `inside` between `object1` and `room`.
- `object1` facing `object2`: edge `inside` between `object1` and `object2`
- `object1` atreach `object`: edge `inside` between `close` and `object2`

# Environment
VirtualHome is composed of 7 scenes where activities can be executed. Each scene is encoded in a dictionary containing a node for every object and edges between them representing relationships. Each environment can be updated by modifying the corresponding  dictionary. 

You can check in the [demo](../demo/unity_demo.ipynb) examples on how to read and update graphs.

| Scene 1   | Scene 2   | Scene 3   | Scene 4   | Scene 5   | Scene 6   | Scene 7  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| ![img](../assets/scene1rot.png) | ![img](../assets/scene2rot.png)| ![img](../assets/scene3rot.png)| ![img](../assets/scene4rot.png)| ![img](../assets/scene5rot.png)| ![img](../assets/scene6rot.png)| ![img](../assets/scene7rot.png)

You can check here the list of supported node states, edge relations and object properties in the graphs representing the environment. 

*Note that this documentation holds for both Unity Simulator and Evolving Graph*.

## Relations
Possible relations (edge labels) are:

- **on**
- **inside**
- **between**  _used for door object, if door is between kitchen and livingroom, we have edges `door` between `livingroom` and `door` between `kitchen`_
- **close** edge `object1` close `object2` denotes that the distance between center of `object1` (`object2`) to the bounding 
box of `object2` (`object1`) is < 1.5 units (~meters)  
- **facing** there is an edge `object1` facing `object2` if `object2` is lookable, is visible from `object1`, and the 
distance between the centers is < 5 units (~meters). If `object1` is a sofa or a chair
 it should also be turned towards `object2`
- **holds_rh**  _edge `character` holds_rh `object` is used to indicate that character holds an object in its right hand_
- **holds_lh**  _analogue of holds_rh for left hand_
